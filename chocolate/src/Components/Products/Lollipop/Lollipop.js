                                Lahnaâ€™s Caramel Lollipop is one of the most delicious chocolate confections in the world.
                                Heaven on a stick. Handmade caramel dipped in chocolate. When you first hold this lollipop
                                you feel like a child again. And when you take your first bite you act like a child again.
                                For some reason you seem to get it all over your face and hands. And we mean ALL over your
                                face and hands. Like a child. You have been forwarned.
                            </p>
